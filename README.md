# Covid_Data_Analysis_Project

Two Covid Datasets (JSON format) were used to extract data.

Dataset - 1: -

https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/data.min.json

DataSet - 2: -

https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/timeseries.min.json

1. I used Python to extract the data and convert it into csv format from the json files.

Used Python Libraries: - Pandas, Requests, Numpy, and JSON

PFA related file of data extraction: - (“Covid_Project_json_to_csv.ipynb”)

Extracted and cleaned multiple tables are stored in “Cleaned Extracted Data” folder.

2. Used SQL and Excel to get insights from those tables. “Covid_Project.sql” file contains all sql 

queries used to derive insights. 

3. Also used some statistics for getting some statistical insights like correlations, rates of deaths, 

Etc. This part was done in Excel. 

4. “Project_dashboard.xlsx” file contains the summarised Dashboard. There are multiple 

dashboards in this file which are interactive.
